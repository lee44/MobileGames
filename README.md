# Mobile Game Apps
I made two Android game apps using Unity called Galaga and Chinese Puzzle. Galaga is based on the classic arcade game and it was my first game I built using Unity. However Chinese Puzzle is a game I created and built from scratch. The game took three months to build and came with all sorts of challenges.
