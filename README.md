# Mobile Game Apps
I made two Android game apps using Unity called Galaga and Chinese Puzzle. Galaga is based on the classic arcade game and it was my first game I built using Unity. However Chinese Puzzle is a game I created and built from scratch. The game took three months to build. Both games are published on Google Play Store. Links are at the bottom of page.

## Galaga

## How to Play
Just like the original Galaga game, the goal is to outmaneuver and kill as many enemy ships and defeat the final boss.
